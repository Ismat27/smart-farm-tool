# Prembly's Hackathon 2022: Exploring Endless Possibilities With API

## Presentation by TEAM TRANSFORMERS

### Problem Statement

- Many a time, farmers crops are infested by diseases, some resides in the remote areas and they seek for cure, who to talk to for prompt   response and advice.
- They also face challenges of how to convey their goods from the point of harvest to the point of sale.
- They are also faced with a disjoint of community where the can share their ideas as well as ordeal and seek help from fellow experienced farmers.
- Farmers are also saddled with the ordeal of looking for heavy duty equipment such as tractors and bulldozers for mechanized farming.
- Farmers most times miss year planning and run into low yield
- Farmers most times need loan to improve crop yield and production (only accessible by verified farmers)

### SOLUTION

We developed a platform where farmers can sign up as well as experts such as botanists, etc.

The farmers can get prompt AI diagnosis of the plant disease by uploading the diseased plant leave and the model predicts the disease, causal factors, recommendations and refers them to an expert consultant. They can book an appointment with a consultant through live chat for prompt response.

The consultants as well as the farmers have to sign up on our platform and get verified using their phone number and NIN (here we consumed the preamblyâ€™s API)

The farmer has to pay a token to subscribe to the platform for the services. Each consultation fee is paid directly to us and its shared based on percentage between us and the consultants.

This platform also links farmers to truck drivers who can convey their goods from the point of harvest to the point of sale. Also, farmers can schedule physical consultations or visits of experts to their farm.

Farmers can also be linked to organizations for hiring of heavy-duty equipment for mechanized farming.
